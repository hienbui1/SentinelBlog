    <!-- Why I Chose This Exercise -->
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why I Chose This Exercise</h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-400 mb-6">
      The incline dumbbell chest press focuses on building the upper chest — an area that's often underdeveloped in standard training programs.
      It allows for a deeper range of motion than barbells, improves shoulder stability, and balances muscle imbalances between sides. How I like to set this up
      is to have the seat just one notch up. For me, that's enough incline for where my chest is not in the flat position, and my shoulders aren't playing
      a big role in this exercise.
