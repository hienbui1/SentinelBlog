    <!-- Why I Chose This Exercise -->
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why I Chose This Exercise</h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-400 mb-6">
      The barbell squat is the king of all compound movements. It builds explosive strength, functional mobility, and full-body coordination. Squatting with proper form
      challenges the legs, core, and stabilizers more than almost any other lift, making it essential for anyone chasing real strength and physique development.
      Personal preference, I like squating in flats, beltless and with knee sleeves for knee joint health. You can use gear, but form is always going to be
      key to performing a safe lift.
